# NeuroNudge
NeuroNudge is a desktop-based AI assistant designed to enhance productivity and well-being through real-time emotion recognition and behavioral analysis. By combining webcam-based facial emotion detection with user activity tracking (typing speed, mouse movement, etc.), it provides personalized nudges that align with the user’s mental and emotional state.

Key Capabilities:

1)Emotion Detection:
Uses facial recognition via the webcam to monitor emotions such as stress, frustration, focus, or fatigue in real time.
Tracks behavioral patterns like typing speed and mouse movements to refine emotional state prediction.

2)Adaptive Productivity Interventions:
Provides personalized nudges tailored to the user’s current mood.
Examples include:
Reminders to take breaks when stress levels rise.
Motivational quotes to boost morale.
Calming or energizing music recommendations.
Intelligent task reordering based on mental readiness.
Well-being Monitoring:
Tracks long-term emotional and behavioral data.
Generates weekly well-being reports that highlight mood trends, productivity peaks, and burnout risks.

3)Flow State Optimization:
Helps users achieve and sustain a “flow state” through ambient controls (lighting, background music, environment adjustments).
AI-powered scheduling aligns tasks with the user’s optimal emotional and cognitive state.

Benefits:
Promotes mental well-being by preventing burnout and encouraging healthy work habits.
Improves task efficiency by ensuring tasks are tackled at the right emotional moment.
Encourages data-driven self-awareness, helping users reflect on their habits and emotional patterns.
Acts as a smart personal assistant that adapts to the individual, rather than forcing rigid workflows.
